**Platform**: PC  
**Engine**: GameMaker  
**Language**: GML
**Date**: 2024
**Game description**: 2D platformer consisting of 2 simple levels

**Description**: A project done in a team of 6 people for an exam. The task was to make a small game (15-25 minutes of gameplay) in 8 weeks without using third-party assets.

The story of the game revolves around a young child who has lost all of their memory. The child is trying to find pieces of their memory by interacting with the local inhabitants â€“ frogs. The player can perform classic movements: moving forward, backward, and jumping. During the journey, the character can collect items, which can be exchanged with the frogs for pieces of memory.

The main difficulty was the pressure of tight deadlines, which made it even harder to come up with a story from scratch. Additionally, balancing the story and gameplay elements with the time constraints proved to be challenging. Due to the lack of time, some planned gameplay features and mechanics were not included in the final version of the game.
